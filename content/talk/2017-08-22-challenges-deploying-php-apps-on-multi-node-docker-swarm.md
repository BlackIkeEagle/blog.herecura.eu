How do we get started with docker swarm and how do we get to the point we can
properly deploy and update our php applications. Can we just add and remove
nodes, what about our data?

The repo with the demo swarm and demo deployments can be found

When time permits I will fix the Pimcore deployment so the session handling
works properly.
