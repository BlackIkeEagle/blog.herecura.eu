How to get started developing PHP applications with Lando.

<!--more-->

The goal of this presentation is to get to know what we can do with
[Lando](https://lando.dev). And learn what its capabilities are. Going from a
simple hello-world from the documentation to a development environment for a
Magento project.

The examples of the presentation can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/BlackIkeEagle/lando-playground).
