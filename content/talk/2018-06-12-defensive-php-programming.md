We always start with the best intentions when we create a new project. But over
time we might end up with parts of our code that are hard to read or/and
understand.

<!--more-->

Here we will take you through a series of exercises you can apply to your day
to day coding. These should help you to end up with more readable code. Also in
the second part we will talk about some best practices, when incorporated will
give you improved code and readability. And to end there are other factors to
take into account, people will use or abuse your application and there are
external tools to help you with that.

When done we should have some idea how to incorporate the tricks in our day to
day programming tasks.
