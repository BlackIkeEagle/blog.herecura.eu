Ike is a developer at [Studio Emma](https://www.studioemma.com/) (Belgium). Mainly focussed on DevOps and PHP development. But also building some tooling in python and being git manual. Providing a vagrant box provisioned with puppet to make sure we can develop in an environment practically the same as production.

In his free time the biggest interest is Metal music and [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/). Being a [Trusted User](https://www.archlinux.org/people/trusted-users/#idevolder) at Archlinux means following up on new software is part of the 'free' time :).
